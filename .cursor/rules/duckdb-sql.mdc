## Description
When working with SQL files, we use DuckDB as our database engine. SQL files should be executed using the command `duckdb $DUCKDB_DATABASE -f {file}`.
## Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use SQLFluff for formatting with DuckDB dialect
- Format on save
## Commands

## Best Practices
