#  Opendata Stack: ðŸš•ðŸ—½  ðŸ“Š  NYC TLC Trip Record Data

## Overview

### Objective

Build a modern data analytics and machine learning platform that provides a scalable foundation for ingesting, transforming, and analyzing data. Using NYC taxi trip data as a practical example, this platform demonstrates how to build robust data pipelines with modern tooling.

### Scope

The solution covers the full data lifecycleâ€”from extraction of raw datasets available on NYCâ€™s Open Data portal, through transformation and storage, to advanced analytics and visualization. The system is designed as a Work In Progress (WIP) that will evolve through iterative enhancements.

### Business Process

#### Process Being Measured
Taxi and For-Hire Vehicle trips in NYC, segmented by Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, and FHV data.

#### Goals

- Build a scalable data platform that enables rapid analytics development
- Implement robust data pipelines with built-in quality checks and monitoring
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflows from data ingestion to model deployment
- Create reproducible analytics that drive data-informed decision making
- Showcase modern data stack integration patterns and best practices

## Engineering Vision

This is a **Work In Progress (WIP)** project to visualize and analyze **NYC Taxi Trips** data using modern, open-source data tooling.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a **modern data stack pipeline** using the tools listed below. The design emphasizes:

- **Multi-Engine Stack**: Utilize **DuckDB** locally for fast prototyping and lightweight analysis, and **Snowflake** in production for scalability and performance.
- **Open Table Formats**: Incorporate **Delta Lake** or other open table formats to ensure compatibility, flexibility, and performance.
- **Open Catalogs**: Leverage **open metadata catalogs** for better discoverability, governance, and interoperability.


### ðŸ§° Tools Planned

- **Orchestration**: [**Dagster**](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) To orchestrate and monitor the pipeline, ensuring tasks are executed reliably and dependencies are managed effectively.
- **Data Warehouse**:
    - [**DuckDB**](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb): A high-performance SQL OLAP engine for local and small-scale analysis.
    - **Snowflake**: For production-scale analytics, providing scalability and enterprise-grade performance.
- **Extract & Load**: [**dlt**](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) To extract raw data from NYCâ€™s Open Data portal (Yellow, Green, and HVFHV taxi trips) and load it into the data warehouse.
- **Transform**: [**dbt**](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) For building modular, reusable, and version-controlled transformations in SQL, enabling robust data modeling of NYC Taxi data.
- **Business Intelligence (BI)**: [**Evidence**](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) A modern, lightweight BI tool for creating visually appealing and shareable reports about taxi trips and trends.
